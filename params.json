{"name":"Living Globe","tagline":"3D world demography visualisation in three.js","body":"# Living Globe\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nLiving Globe is an application for tri-dimensional worldwide demographical data\r\nvisualization. It allows the simultaneous representation of multiple\r\nindicators, like total population, density, population-growth, life expectancy,\r\nnet migration, crude birth rate, crude death rate and the ratio between the\r\nlast two. The mapping of data to the provided visual structures is configurable\r\nby the user, introducing an aspect of customization which encourages a more\r\nimmediate, visual-only interpretation of the data. Additionally, the\r\nrepresented data is normalized within an adjustable scale. This can be used to\r\nfilter out extremely high or extremely low samples, uniforming the remaining\r\ndata and improving its visibility.\r\n\r\nThe results from preliminary testing indicate that the data filtering and\r\ncustomizable mapping features encourage the fast reading of relational\r\ninformation. Moreover, this tool improves on previous state-of-the-art work by\r\nimplementing interaction capabilities like selection, search and filtering.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n    Copyright 2015 University of Aveiro\r\n\r\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n    limitations under the License.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
