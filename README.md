Data visualization application that allows the simultaneous representation of
multiple spatial indicators on a 3D globe. The mapping of data to the provided
visual structures is configurable by the user, introducing an aspect of
customization which encourages a more immediate, visual-only interpretation of
the data. The user can also filter out extremely high or extremely low samples,
normalizing the remaining data and improving its visibility.

This application has been developed as part of a research paper (E. Duarte, P.
Bordonhos, P. Dias, B. S. Santos, *Living Globe: Tridimensional Interactive
Visualization of World Demographic Data*) and presented at HCI International
2016, The Westin Harbour Castle Hotel, Toronto, Canada. [**Links to the
