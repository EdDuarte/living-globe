# 3D earth

A simple 3D visualisation of world population, birth-rate and mortality rate.

It displays demographic data for the majority of the capitals around the world, and improves on previous state-of-the-art work by implementing interaction capabilities like selection, search and filtering, allowing for a more detailed observation and comparisson of the data.

Shown data is scaled to a minimum and maximum population, density, birth-rate or death-rate value that can be changed, so as to avoid skewness due to the excedingly large samples sitting in China and India.
