## Description

Living Globe is an application for tri-dimensional worldwide demographical data
visualization. It allows the simultaneous representation of multiple
indicators, like total population, density, population-growth, life expectancy,
net migration, crude birth rate, crude death rate and the ratio between the
last two. The mapping of data to the provided visual structures is configurable
by the user, introducing an aspect of customization which encourages a more
immediate, visual-only interpretation of the data. Additionally, the
represented data is normalized within an adjustable scale. This can be used to
filter out extremely high or extremely low samples, uniforming the remaining
data and improving its visibility.

The results from preliminary testing indicate that the data filtering and
customizable mapping features encourage the fast reading of relational
information. Moreover, this tool improves on previous state-of-the-art work by
implementing interaction capabilities like selection, search and filtering.
