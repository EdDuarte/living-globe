# Contribution Guidelines

Contribution are always **welcome and recommended**! Here is how:

- Fork the repository ([here is the guide](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/));
- Clone to your machine ```git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/living-globe.git```;
- Make your changes;
- Create a pull request.

#### Branches:

When forking the project, make sure you clone and contribute on the right branch:
- 'master' and 'gh-pages' are the production branch for the latest version of the project (v2). Both branches are always up-to-par with each other ('gh-pages' rebases 'master' commits);
- 'v1' is the development branch for the first version of the project;
- 'v2' is the development branch for the second (and latest) version of the project.

#### Contribution Requirements:

- When you contribute, you agree to give a non-exclusive license to anyone be able to use that contribution in any context they see appropriate;
- If you use content provided by another party, it must be appropriately licensed using an [open source](http://opensource.org/licenses) license;
- Contributions are only accepted through Github pull requests;
- Contributed code must work in all supported browsers (see above for browser support).
